Act as a professional full-stack web app builder. I want you to create a complete, cleanly designed social web application where users can create, view, and share posts with images or videos. It should have modern animations, authentication, and a public feed.

🔧 Key Features:
👤 User Authentication
Email/password sign up, login, logout


Use JWT or secure cookies for session management


Users can view posts without login, but must log in to create a post


📝 Create Posts
Form to create a post with:


Text fields (title + description)


Upload support for images and videos


Uploaded media should be stored in Cloudinary


Posts should be saved to MongoDB with:


Timestamp


User info (email or name)


Media URL


📰 Post Feed (Public)
Anyone can view all posts in a responsive grid/card layout


Each card shows:


User info


Title & description


Image/video


Timestamp


Posts should be sorted by latest


💫 UI & Animations
Use Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/UI (or Chakra UI)


Use GSAP or Framer Motion for:


Page transitions


Smooth hover and entry effects


Mobile responsive design
